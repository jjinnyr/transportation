## Notes for the Milestone Review 
This text is a write-up of our project goals, background, and design process. It includes notes on things that are in progress, but the overall vision and scope of our project is laid out here. The current state of completed code is not as far as we would like. Our team pivoted from another project idea that did not work out, and we spent most of this week finding a new direction. We are confident that we can make good progress now that we have this direction.

# Introduction

Transportation safety is an issue that impacts everyone, but it is especially important for those of use who walk, bike, use a wheelchair, or otherwise mix with car traffic without the safety afforded by a car. These road users are dubbed ‘Vulnerable Road Users’ or VRUs in transportation circles [1]. In the past year, over 200 pedestrians and 150 cyclists have been involved in collisions in Seattle, with at least 12 pedestrian fatalities in 2021 [2, 3].  This is despite the city’s stated ‘vision zero’ goal of reducing traffic deaths to zero by 2030 [4]. One important factor in reducing VRU collisions is infrastructure. Infrastructure items like crosswalks and bike lanes have been shown to reduce collisions and fatalities [5]. But not every intersection has a crosswalk, and not every road has a bike lane in Seattle. This raises questions about where these infrastructure items are located in Seattle, and who has access to them. Are these items distributed equitably around the city so that all may benefit, or is access to life-saving infrastructure a privilege granted to a subset of Seattleites? Are there specific locations that lack crosswalks where installing one would improve the day -to- day life of nearby residents? These are important questions to answer in considering how to allocate new transportation infrastructure. A 2015 report from People for Bikes, a US bicycling advocacy organization, explored the intersection of cycling and equity [6]. Findings in the report show that people of color are leading a surge in bicycling in the US, but are also more likely to be killed riding their bikes. This report cites survey data showing that people of color are more interested in riding bikes for transportation, and are also more likely to ride if they have access to infrastructure like protected bike lanes. This report specifically calls out south Seattle for lacking safe cycling infrastructure. In this project, our team has set out to design a visualization that can address these sorts of questions. We seek to find an answer to the research question: How can we best visualize how alternative transportation infrastructure distributions in Seattle intersect with population distributions?

# Background, Previous Work, and Motivation

Manaswi Saha, a PhD Candidate at UW, has identified the role of a visualization’s user or stakeholder, and how this impacts the necessary level of granularity, as a key design parameter in geo-visual representations of urban accessibility data [7]. In her recent paper and in personal conversations, she describes how different stakeholders in the infrastructure process have different needs around how to use a visualization. These needs are driven by the tasks they perform relative to the infrastructure. For example, they found that wheelchair users are interested in seeing very detailed and hyperlocal visualizations, as they tend to think of infrastructure in terms of how they are getting from point A to point B. On the other hand, policy makers prefer visualizations that abstract data at the city level to better understand trends that drive policy decisions. People filling the role of advocates strike a balance between these two positions: They make use of city-level visualizations for understanding broad trends and communicating with policy makers, but also expect the detailed, local visualizations to drill into specific problems and communicate with infrastructure users. These findings were distilled down into a set of best practices for designing geovisualization of urban accessibility data. These include designing visualizations that target the sensemaking process of the target user and include the details that are relevant to that process. Users should be able to access multiple map types to view data from different perspectives. People need to trust the data that is being visualized. Support for comparison between data should be included. Users want to be able to see the ‘why’, not just the ‘what’ of the data. Her work focused on infrastructure accessibility issues (i.e. wheelchair passability) in particular, but we believe that these insights are directly transferable to the similar issue of alternative transportation infrastructure.


In our review of existing work on the question of alternative transportation infrastructure distribution and equity, we found that most communications involving visualization tend to fall into two broad categories. The first is to plot infrastructure on a google-maps type interface using some sort of GIS (geographic information system) based tool. The best example we have come across is from the Puget Sound Regional Council [8]. While these tools do allow a hyper-local exploration of data, they do not allow a user to easily understand city-wide trends. They also do not allow the incorporation of other relevant information, such as demographic datasets. In our subjective opinions, they also are not visually appealing and do not invite one to explore and understand the data. The second camp is to explore infrastructure vs. equity data at a city-wide and up level. The report on equity and cycling from People for Bikes mentioned above [6] looks at this issue at a city -to - national level, using plots of aggregate statistics when visualizations are used.  This is great for demonstrating the existence of a problem, but it does not allow one to explore local issues to suggest solutions.  


We believe there is a gap that needs to be filled in providing a visualization that represents pedestrian and bike infrastructure and allows comparisons with demographic and other datasets. This visualization tool should allow the user to explore this data at a variety of granularity levels, as Saha suggests. It is also important to allow for the inclusion of specific context information showing how conditions affect real people, or explaining why things are the way they are. By designing a visualization that addresses these shortcomings and follows best practices laid out in previous work for communicating on these issues, we hope to build a tool that advances the conversation around the advancement of alternative transportation infrastructure in an equitable manner. 

# Visualization Design
## Data sources
Many types of transportation and street-related infrastructure could fall under the realm of alternative transportation infrastructure and be relevant to this work. Sidewalks, crosswalks, and bike lanes are some of the more mainstream and objective examples. Other important examples include traffic calmed streets and intersections, low-traffic streets like Seattle’s Stay Healthy Streets, or accessibility specific infrastructure. We focus on this work on bike lanes and crosswalks as these have a large impact on VRU safety and are easily quantified. The City of Seattle publishes geo-tagged datasets of marked crosswalk and bike lane locations. We based our infrastructure visualizations on this data. To show demographic trends, we are using data from the 2020 Census. We tried dividing the city by census tract, but found that these areas were too granular to compare infrastructure across. We are now exploring the use of neighborhood boundaries, and may change this further. We also rely on Seattle street data and seattle city border data to construct our visualizations 

## Layout and Encodings
In designing our visualization structure, we focused on a hypothetical ‘advocate’ user of the tool. We consider an advocate to be someone who is not necessarily personally involved in the issue at hand, but who cares deeply about it and works to solve it. As identified in Saha, the key aspect in designing a visualization for use by advocates is to support analysis at multiple length scales and granularity levels. We expect a user to start an exploration by looking at the city-wide level of granularity, then find interesting regions to dive into and view in detail. To support this, we (will) provide two main visualizations, and interactions to navigate between them. When first visiting the page, a choropleth of the city, broken into census tracts, loads. This choropleth plots the demographics and composite accessibility score for that tract. The demographics are plotted as the ratio of People of Color. Our accessibility score is computed by averaging the normalized miles of bike lanes and number of crosswalks per mile of road in the census tract. The validity of this metric is up for debate. Encodings for these variables are still under development and we welcome ideas here. In this city-wide map, road details are included as Saha found that including geographic information helps users place themselves in the map.  When users click on a tract, detailed granular information about that tract is (will be) displayed in a composite visualization below. A map (will) plot the detailed transportation infrastructure for the census tract, allowing users to see exactly what infrastructure is within the tract. This supports the fine-grained visualization Saha identified as important for advocates in identifying specific problems and in working with local user stakeholder. We also plan to add an option to add or remove specific infrastructure types - users could use this to remove crosswalks if they only want to consider bike lanes. This local view (will) also plots the racial breakdown of residents of that census tract using a pie chart. We may also add other demographic data, like income. We are working on developing a way to provide individual context as suggested by Saha in personal communications. The goal here is to incorporate non-quantitative data and stories, such as highlighting the stories of individuals who have been impacted by alternative transportation infrastructure or a lack thereof. This does not directly support our goal of providing a tool to advocates, but would support a logical extension of using this tool to convince people that we need change.

# Future work to realize this as a tool
As it stands, a valid criticism of our work is that we built a visualization, not a visualization tool. We have identified a few things to fix that would make this useful as a tool, but these are either beyond our skillsets or the scope of this class project. First, this tool would have to be extended  to work for other cities. Technically this is feasible. As long as infrastructure, census tract data, and street map data are available for a city in geoJSON format, our data prep workflow could be easily wrapped into a few functions and applied to a new location. Configuring a web service or other interface to make this usable without editing javascript is out of the scope of a visualization class though. Second, a formal user verification and feedback study that asks actual transportation advocates or engineers to use our tool would allow us to incorporate feedback and make improvements. Finally, adding features that allow our visualizations to support a compelling narrative around transportation equity make this a tool that can be used to inspire action. Our original goal with this project was to build a narrative along these lines, it evolved to focus more on the visualization considerations involved in this problem. As our visualizations stand, they actually show that transportation infrastructure in Seattle is fairly evenly distributed. This makes the case for building a narrative a bit weaker, but is also a questionable finding. We need to dive deeper into the data, and consider whether the metric we are using to represent transportation infrastructure is a valid one.
